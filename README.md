# hacking-law-proto

This is our prototype which we've created at the hackathon that was part of the [hacking.law](http://media.hacking.law) event.  
We've tried to implement a system that handles temporary employment agreements based on [Ethereum's](https://ethereum.org/) smart contract ecosystem.  
The whole vision can be found in this [Medium Blog](https://blog.hacking.law/blockchain-technology-and-the-future-of-temporary-employment-51ff7062b6).
Unfortunately, we had no time to continue our work on this project after the hackathon.  
We've made first experiences with [truffle](http://truffleframework.com) as a testing framework. A Scheme that was used to design the prototype can be found inside the docs folder inside the truffle directory.

If you like the vision and want to continue our work, fell free to contact one of us (team members are shown inside the Medium blog) and fork / contribute to this repository.  
We would be very happy to see this prototype growing.
